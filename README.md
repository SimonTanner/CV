## Simon Tanner

I’ve been called many things in my life, but of the words that keeps coming up is poly-math. Many of the people who’ve gotten to know me have remarked about the number of different skills and interests I’ve acquired, from cooking to design, to studying Theoretical Physics at UCL recently. I’ve worked for several years in interior and architectural design, and despite working on some exciting and interesting projects, ranging from designing properties in Mayfair and Knightsbridge to historic department stores such as Fortnum & Mason, this has never really challenged me creatively or intellectually. For me variety is the spice of life and having to adapt, learn new skills and push the limits of my understanding truly makes me feel alive. I also believe that true creativity can be applied to anything, not just the arts, take the theory of relativity for instance. I don’t think you can get much more creative than coming up for a new paradigm on how we understand the very fabric of space and time. 

Having completed my 2nd degree in Physics in 2015, I’ve been working in design & visualisation all the while trying to figure out what I can apply all the things I’ve learnt from two disparate fields and eventually caught the coding bug. I initially started teaching myself python and even recently wrote a program to help me with a clothing design side project called Biodesic. Whilst I found this really fascinating I knew that I didn’t yet possess the skills that would enable me to get a great job in the industry. And that’s where Maker’s Academy came in. I’m now learning Ruby as well as other software development tools (e.g. github) and methodologies (e.g. OOP & TDD) which I hope will lead to a career which will really push and challenge me.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Studying Theoretical Physics and the Maths was an incredibly mind-expanding experience. Some of the techniques and concepts involved require one to think both logically, laterally abstractly in order to find a solution to the given problem. During my Final Project where as a team we investigated different technologies for fine tuning the direction of a Cube Satellite, I was able to create a simulation using Mathematica to calculate the effects of atmospheric drag, allowing us to visualise and test different models and produce data for the forces and torques produced depending on altitude and orientation. Studying Physics has also taught me the importance of questioning assumptions you make whilst trying to solve a problem. It’s often easy to have a gut feeling about a problem, which if not questioned, can send you in wrong direction and this is something that I have realised applies to coding as well. Questioning your assumptions often leads you to realise that many are in fact wrong, and allows you to solve problems quicker and more effectively. 

Whilst working in architecture I was able to apply my skills to designing structures using parametric modelling software, using a mix of CAD techniques and scripts in a C++ based language, to design a dia-grid roof structure and geometrically complex staircase.


### Analytical Thinking

Having studied and worked in design for a number of years I’ve realised how important a skill it is to be able to take a project brief, break it down into a number of key points and then create a solution which meets these criteria. It’s often easy to get carried away with an idea and this can often mean you get somewhat distracted. Whilst this may lead to a great concept, it might not be what the client has actually requested. Taking the time to analyse the problem or brief is crucial to creating a great solution.

### Communication/Team Work

The ability to communicate effectively is such an important attribute and is also vital for good team work. My background in design has given me a great basis for discussing and communicating my ideas. No matter how good a proposal you create, if you can’t convey this verbally it often means people won’t fully appreciate what you’ve done. During my design degree, I was short listed for an award for a design competition run by the Royal Society of Arts. I had to present my concept, for a piece of furniture, to a panel of industry experts and I was awarded a prize of £3,000 for this.

I’ve also worked as a lecturer (Kingston University) whilst studying my 2nd degree, and a Teaching Assistant where finding ways to communicate subjects or concepts to students was vital. At Kingston I was teaching 1st year students, many of whom often struggled to understand the project briefs and what was required from them. I was able to explain what they needed to do, as well as help them work out where they wanted to take the project.
